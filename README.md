# Air-Quality-

Dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anveshparashar/airqualityuci
I ran Logistic Classification on the dataset to predict the temperate based on the air quality. We used R2 score to determine the goodness of the model - a statistical measure of how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points.
